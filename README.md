##### Challenges :

The main problem I had with this assignment was wrapping my head around the whole concept. I used the example we worked on today as a guideline and the Sinatra roadmap really helped with understanding how everything was connected and the whole order of things.
I tried to do it from scratch which was really helpful in terms of familiarising myself with all the components involved (mainly the error page, if Sinatra doesn't know this ditty or spills his whiskey, chances are you got a typo somewhere or he's not happy about something. Keep ol' blue eyes happy).
I found that as I was working I kind of understood things a lot better.

##### Take-Aways :

I think it went really well, better than I thought it would to be honest. Pretty happy wit the progress so far. Once I got everything set up the rest went relatively smoothly, which was great. 

Though it  was already clear before, Sinatra kind of emphasised this for me : A typo helped end WWII, it can also break your code. don't underestimate the power typos, if it doesn't need to be there it will only get in the way!! 

Other than that, the not so restful roots weren't that bad, it's just a matter of practice and getting used to the works. 

I give it a 7/10.
